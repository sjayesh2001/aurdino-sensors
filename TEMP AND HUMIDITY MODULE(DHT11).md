#TEMP AND HUMIDITY MODULE(DHT11)
The **DHT11** is a commonly used **Temperature and humidity sensor.**The sensor comes with a dedicated NTC to measure temperature and an 8-bit microcontroller to output the values of temperature and humidity as serial data.
The sensor can measure temperature from 0°C to 50°C and humidity from 20% to 90% with an accuracy of ±1°C and ±1%.
